Tell me if this sounds familiar:

You're working on a project, you spend a seemingly endless amount of time and energy getting everything prepared - requirements figured out, all the research pulled together, the outline for the final product, everything - and now it's time to finally get to work and make something you can be proud of.  Then, at the last second, someone comes in and "takes over for you" and you have to sit and watch from the sidelines as they complete and publish the project you worked so hard to set up...

For the past few years, I've been working in the software development space, but without in-depth coding knowledge, this has been the end result of every project I've worked on. With each passing project, my desire to learn the coding, so that I can be the one to publish the final product, has grown and now, I've finally decided that I've had enough and it's time for me to make that jump into code.

So, why did I choose to learn coding?  Because I want the opportunity to flex my creative muscles in a productive way.  The chance to create something that people really use and love, and that I can physically look at and show off with pride. To put it shortly, I'm not an administrator, I'm a builder and it's time I get to building.
